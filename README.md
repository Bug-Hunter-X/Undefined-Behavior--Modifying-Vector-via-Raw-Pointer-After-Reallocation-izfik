This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving undefined behavior due to misuse of raw pointers and vector reallocation. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to modify a vector's element through a raw pointer after the vector has potentially been reallocated. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a safe alternative using proper Rust memory management techniques.
